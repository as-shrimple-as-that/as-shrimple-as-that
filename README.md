# Sup, loser.

## Heya! Call me Welfoe!

I make stuff sometimes!

I'm learning Python right now, to get a basic grasp on how computers and coding works. What I plan to do next is learn how to code in Lua, since I want to move on to make games and stuff, as I've always been the kind of girl who wants to entertain people. <br> <br>

So far, this process of learning Python has made me able to identify bugs in **other people's games without even knowing the language its written in and seeing their code,** so I'd say it's working out well.
