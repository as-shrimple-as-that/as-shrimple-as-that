\> I make stuff sometimes!

\> I'm learning Python right now, to get a basic grasp on how computers and coding works. What I plan to do next is learn how to code in Lua, since I want to move on to make games and stuff, as I've always been the kind of girl who wants to entertain people. <br> <br>

\> So far, this process of learning Python has made me able to identify bugs in **other people's games without even knowing the language its written in and seeing their code,** so I'd say it's working out well. I can fully diagnose not only the replicative cause, but also the internal cause and how they can fix it. It's pretty rare that I can, but it happened just yesterday, so I'm pretty proud of that.

\> I'm a very creative loser, and I have ***NO*** idea what I'm doing at all, but it all works out as long as I don't get out of my chair. **Do not get out of the chair.**

## > Capabilities n' stuff

\> I'm probably currently most experienced with Python, but I also know a TON about HTML and CSS, and then a little about Markdown (what this is written in), PHP, Lua, and that one fake coding language your school makes up when you're nine to make you feel smart.

\> I'm good at making art as well, which includes graphic design and 3D textures (with a bit of trial and error). I *have* animated in the past, but it's so terribly embarrasing that it's HARDLY worth mention. Done a little bit of stuff with Blender, but I'm still terrible with it to this day. One of my proudest accomplishments is spending 7 hours on 14 lines of code, only to realize that the error was that I didn't make the loop function in the code end.

\> I use <a href="https://replit.com/~">Replit</a> for most of my coding, simply because I'm too lazy to use anything else ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

\> I have a bit of experience with <a href="https://www.roblox.com/create">Roblox Studio</a>, but as with most "bits of experience," it's hardly worth a mention.

\> Plan to *maybe* use <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a>, dunno what it's capable of though. There's still a lot of research to be done in that area.

\> A lot of the time, my more high-effort projects might be based on memes or inside jokes, no clue why, but entertainment is my motivation.
